randperm(N,m) returns m randomly chosen integers from the set [1...N]
--using randperm(N,1) to choose a random index

available_index[]={1,2,3...9}

A[9]={}

for turn=1 to 9
  -check if any player is about to win, ie, has two lined up moves. If the game finishes, exit the loop
  -Otherwise, randomly choose an index from the list of available indexes
  -odd turns signify player who moved first, and even signifies the other
  -player1's moves fill in A with weights equal to 5; player2 fills in with 50
  @Omar we should try with weights +1 and -1
  -at the end of the ninth turn, if no one has won, a draw has taken place

We'll add the winner's data to Xtrain and ytrain.
** In case of a draw we're adding both player's data.

On average, a game ends in 5/6 moves. A hundred iterations thus gives us a dataset sized approximately in the range of 500 to 600 labeled examples.

Possible approaches:
-Multiclass classification with one vs all logistic regression
-Neural network, deep learning approach
-SVM kernels
